# csvGenerator2.0
An Express.js route that integrates data from three different API endpoints, extracts specific key values from their responses, writes these values into a CSV file based on where user.id matches with post.userid and post.id matches with post.id matches with comment.postid, and returns the path to the generated CSV file.
